## 1. Introduction
SONOFF Dongle Flasher supports online firmware flashing for the iHost MG21 chip and the SONOFF Dongle series (ZBDongle-P, ZBDongle-E, Dongle-M, Dongle-PMG24 and Dongle-LMG21).

In addition to the SONOFF Dongle Flasher add-on, we also provide a container version that can be installed from the following address:
amd64:  https://hub.docker.com/r/ewelink/sonoff-dongle-flasher-amd64
aarch64:  https://hub.docker.com/r/ewelink/sonoff-dongle-flasher-aarch64
armv7:  https://hub.docker.com/r/ewelink/sonoff-dongle-flasher-armv7

## 2. Prerequisite
Before using the add-on, please make sure the serial port is not in use (it is commonly occupied by services like Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA).
During the firmware flashing process, the add-on will attempt to connect to the device and automatically check whether the serial port is occupied.
If it is, the add-on will try to stop the conflicting service for you.

## 4. Use the **SONOFF Dongle Flasher Add-on** to flash Zigbee firmware

Open the web interface and click **"Connect"**. The tool will automatically scan for the iHost MG21 chip and connected Zigbee Dongles on the device running Home Assistant.
(Currently, only **SONOFF ZBDongle-P**, **SONOFF ZBDongle-E**, **SONOFF Dongle-M**, **SONOFF Dongle-PMG24** and **SONOFF Dongle-LMG21** are supported.)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iHost-Open-Source-Project/hassio-ihost-addon/master/hassio-ihost-sonoff-dongle-flasher/images/MG21_connect_scan.png) 

> </font><font color="red">Note*</font> Before clicking **Connect**, please make sure that **Zigbee2MQTT** and **ZHA** are stopped.Flashing requires access to the serial port, and currently, the add-on will automatically check whether the iHost serial port is occupied by Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA when you click **Connect**.
> 
> If either service is running, the add-on will attempt to stop them automatically.
> 
> If Zigbee2MQTT or ZHA is not stopped beforehand, you may encounter device connection failures during the flashing process.*


### 4.1 Flashing Zigbee NCP Firmware to iHost Internal MG21 Chip

></font><font color="red">Note*</font> If you plan to switch iHost back from Home Assistant to the CUBE system, please first flash the Zigbee firmware back to **version 6.10.9**.Otherwise, data loss or compatibility issues may occur.
>
> Or If you upgrade the firmware directly to **version 7.4 or above**, make sure to initially configure Zigbee2MQTT to use the **ezsp** adapter.Only after Zigbee2MQTT successfully starts with ezsp, you may reconfigure it to use the **ember** adapter.
>
> **Do not skip this process and directly use the ember adapter**, or you may encounter the following risks:* Starting Zigbee2MQTT with the ember adapter may trigger an error:*"The backup file was created from an unsupported EZSP version."*This may force you to reconfigure your entire Zigbee network.
> 
> **Details**: See the [GitHub discussion on v7.4+ firmware compatibility](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/discussions/22919).

> </font><font color="red">Note*</font> When manually flashing firmware to the ZBDongle-P, the progress may sometimes get stuck at 0%.
> 
> **Possible causes:**
> - Mismatched model: The selected device model is ZBDongle-E, but the device connected > to the specified serial port is ZBDongle-P.
> - As a result, the serial port is occupied and cannot be used for another attempt.
> 
> **Please try:**
> - Restart the Add-on to release the serial port.
> - Verify and select the correct de vice model matching your device (ZBDongle-P).
> - Flash the firmware again.
